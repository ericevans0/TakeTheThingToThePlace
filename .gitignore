###########################################

# Assets to import from the Asset Store through Package Manager
# (In some cases, specific assets can be copied into the project-specific folders,
#  to remove the build dependency, but in some cases, such as C# scripts, that causes
#  conflicts. In other cases, it is just more convenient. Also, the full asset pack
#  would generally be needed for continuing development anyway.)
# So, to ensure a working dev environment, and possibly a smooth build, import these:

# Meadow Environment - Dynamic Nature
/[Aa]ssets/NatureManufacture*

# Terrain Sample Asset Pack
/[Aa]ssets/TerrainSampleAssets*
# Note: This asset has package dependencies:
#  com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition
#  com.unity.shadergraph
# These are added to the manifest.json, so I'm
# including those in the commit as I've done with
# other such libraries. Fingers crossed!



# Here are a few files I use in my personal dev process, meant to be temporary
# and of no use to anyone else.
scraps.txt
code-scrap*



# The following exclusions are my additions that don't seem to be properly
# ignored by the unmodified file, but perhaps should be incorporated into it.
